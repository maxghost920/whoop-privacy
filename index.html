  <p>This is a personal-use integration that connects to the Whoop API to retrieve health and fitness data (recovery, strain, sleep, and workout metrics) for a single authorized user.</p>
  <p><strong>Data collected:</strong> Recovery scores, sleep performance, strain, heart rate, and workout data from your Whoop account.</p>
  <p><strong>Data usage:</strong> Data is stored locally and used solely for personal health tracking and analysis. It is not shared with any third parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Data storage:</strong> All data is stored on a private server controlled by the account owner. No data is sold, shared, or transmitted externally.</p>
  <p><strong>Data deletion:</strong> You can revoke access at any time through your Whoop account settings. All locally stored data can be deleted on request.</p>
  <p><strong>Contact:</strong> This is a personal project. For questions, reach the developer directly.</p>
